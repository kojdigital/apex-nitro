## What APEX Front-End Boost is
APEX Front-End Boost is a local web server that hosts and distributes your static files to your APEX application.

APEX Front-End Boost makes coding faster and easier. It helps you manage static files (`js`, `css`, `images`, etc.) more efficiently within an APEX application.

![demo](https://github.com/OraOpenSource/apex-frontend-boost/raw/master/docs/demo.gif)

#### What it does
- Minifies `js` and `css`.
- Generates  `js` and `css` sourcemaps.
- Adds `css` vendor prefixes.
- Concatenates `js` and `css`. *(optional)*
- Parses `scss` and `less` to `css`. *(optional)*
- Generates APEX Theme Roller configuration. *(optional)*
- Adds a standardized header comment block to `js` and `css` files. *(optional)*

#### How it helps you
- Cut down on front-end development time.
- Enhance your application performance due to smaller file sizes.
- Keep coding in your favorite code editor, without having to constantly upload anything to APEX or a web server.
- Stop manual refresh of your browser to get `js` and `css` modification.
- Stop affecting other developers. **Any development done within APEX Front-End Boost affects you and only you**.
- Be notified of `js` and `css` errors as you save.

#### Other benefits
- Makes responsive development easier by synchronizing multiple devices together.
- All devices (desktop, tablet, mobile, etc.) will imitate each others actions (scrolling, clicking, typing).
- Eliminates the need for refreshing the browser. As soon as you save your code in the text editor, you get automatic code injection / reloading in the browser.
